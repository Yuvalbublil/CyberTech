Q1:
Xor with a number x is associative function.
so Xor(Xor(a,c),b) = Xor(Xor(a,b),c)
and if we do this on the decryption of the cbc we made we can reverse the order and
after a simple action of Xor on the first cipher text with IV and Xor on every cipher text with the previous one
we will get the ECB algorithm.

Q2:
if our malware is found they will have the option to read all of our massages and even if we would have sent a new key
they can read it too so all of our connection with the malware is public.
The problem is inherit in the fact that all of the malwares is using the same public key.

Practical Bonus:

I made two functions advance_encrypt and advance_decrypt where all I did is changing the simple Xor cipher block with a new function that do the Xor with the key and replace two bytes with each other replace byte 2n+1 with byte 2n for every n in [0,len(block)//2].
this is breaking the associative of the function and making it harder to decrypt and this is very easy process for the computer to do.
