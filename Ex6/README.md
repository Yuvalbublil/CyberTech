probability to identify a packet as false positive

`P = (MAX_RANDOM_NUMBER)^(-2)`

**P1**

`BPH = 5`

**P2**

`BPH = log2(len(LEGIT_DNS_REQUESTS))*60/CACHE_TIME`

**P5**

we can use:
the sport as a data point, we will get higher risk of false positive but will have alot of data.
aa flag
tc flag

**Theoretical Bonus:**

we can hide the data in the ip we send back as a DNSRR packet this is Bytes


**Practical Bonus**

if I Would implement the sport I will get 
`BPH = 16 * 60/CACHE_TIME`
